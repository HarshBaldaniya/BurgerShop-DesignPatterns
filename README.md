# 🍔 Burger Shop 🌱

Welcome to the Burger Shop, where your plant-based burger dreams come true! Built with TypeScript, this project is a playful exploration of design patterns in software development.

# What's Cooking? 🍳

## Technical Kitchen Tour 🛠

Ingredients of Our Project:

- TypeScript: The chef's choice for crafting scalable and maintainable code.
- Factory Design Pattern (The Menu): Our Factory acts like the burger menu. Just tell it which burger you want, and it'll handle the preparation details. It's great for creating objects.
- Builder Design Pattern (Custom Orders): Prefer to customize your burger? The Builder pattern allows for step-by-step construction of complex objects. It's perfect for when your burger order has lots of optional extras.

## Architectural Blueprint:

Our code kitchen is organized into various sections, ensuring a clean working environment:

- Interfaces: Define the contract for our burgers, ensuring every burger, whether off the menu or custom-made, has the right ingredients and a cook method.
- Burgers: This is where we keep our burger recipes (classes implementing the burger interface), each with its unique mix of ingredients and preparation steps.
- Factories: The heart of our standard menu, deciding which burger class to instantiate based on customer requests.
- Builders: The station for crafting custom burgers, allowing for flexible addition of ingredients.

## Design Pattern Delicacies Explained 📚

- Factory Design Pattern: Imagine walking into a burger shop and ordering directly from the menu. The Factory Pattern is the behind-the-scenes magic that takes your order and delivers the right burger without you needing to know how it's made.
- Builder Design Pattern: For those who like their burger a specific way, the Builder Pattern is like having a conversation with the chef as they build your burger layer by layer, ensuring every ingredient is exactly to your liking.
- Composite Design Pattern:
